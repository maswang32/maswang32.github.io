Specify a concept by collecting examples
train a classifier on these examples wrt random examples or another group (e.g. stripes vs dots)
take the orthogonal vector to this classifier (CAV)
compute the directional derivative of a class label (e.g. zebra) wrt CAV
can use to tell which concepts inform classifier decision
other use cases (see notes)
