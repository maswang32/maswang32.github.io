when you have like

dx = dy

What lets you integrate both sides? If you integrate the RHS from 0 to T, what are the limits of the integral on the RHS?

For diffusion ELBO, what does it mean when we say: changing its parameters so that the static encoder
does approximate the posterior

Under the KL divergence interpretation of NLL, what about the input variable?
Answer: It's the KL divergence for a fixed input. As in, in a regression problem, imagine that for one 
input we observe multiple outputs. Then it's the KL divergence for those outputs vs. the model's predicted distribution
for that input. Or, P(y|x) compared to the distribution over y|x.


Why is it bad that the normalizing constant is not tractable?
Answer: because you can increase the probability of your data distribution arbitrarily



Still not sure about 'independent errors' assumption for modeling multidimensional distributions.


Information theory - why do we care about encoding sequences of events?


What is the meaning of log probability in machine learning? Is there something about 'encoding the information in a distribution'?


Why does PSD Imply Convex?
