# Stemphonic

previous models generate a fixed set of stems

or, they generate one stem at a time

training - apply shared noise latent to each group.


one-pass conditional multi-stem generation


previous work:
1 - parallel architectures for stem generation, but instruments are fixed
2 - sequential generation of stems, flexible, but one-at a time


stem-wise activity controls
