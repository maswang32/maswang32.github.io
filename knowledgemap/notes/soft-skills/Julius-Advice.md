## Julius Story

- Rice, student + musician, technical foundation in DSP
- ESL Job, DSP at sea, played in bands for fun
- MS/EE (while working?)
    - CCRMA, gave hardware + software assistance for access to a computer
    - 300-level classes in EE
    - from gigs to computer music
- Hertz fellowship
- first two years, taking courses, pure interest, and also applicability
    - Kailath + Goodman
- master a branch of the lit: digital filter design / system
- sometimes, a promising idea remains after reading all the lit
- started publishing in 3rd year of PhD

- job at SCT shortly before graduating, adaptive signal processing, dept of systems control tech - not music, but kept publishing in music venues
    - kind of a postdoc

- CCRMA research associate, continue developing waveguide synthesis
    - half time at SCT
    
- couple years later - Steve jobs calls, wants music processing software, very few EE PhDs in music tech - 25th employee and NeXT, replcated SCT, moved down to 1 day per week at CCRMA

- 1989 - full time Prof at CCRMA, CCRMA money came from FM synthesis patent

Lesson: opportunities are unpredictable
But, the big picture is simple. 
- Choose courses according to 'likely relevance', get best education. 
- work best job to develop skills. 
- publish some things (annually).
- pursue music in own way


pursue relationships with the best institutes in the field - brand recognition is important, since there is so much going on.

Today, one needs to tool up to produce on many fronts.

## Choosing your next move
base this off interests, talents, past experience.
    - observe past/present self to see
    - what are your interests really? recurring themes from the past - spontaneous interests that recur reliably.
    - you can decide on what you're interested in, and be wrong
    - major should be emergent after taking all sequences we want - courses reinforce a theme. julius's idea for courses is "achievement unlocked" - take any classes, graduate whenever.
    - graduate courses, depth outweights breadth, important to squeeze these in

## Short-Term Research

Daily: Read Paper, replicate results
Weekly: summarize work from past week, describe plan for next week, present papers.


## Prioritizing Ideas:

Priority = Significance / (Difficulty * Number of People Working on it)


## Ideal Research Paper Outline

1. Abstract - Terse Summary of rest, and conclusions
2. Intro - setting, problem statement, motivation: application area, problem addressed, why it is important
    - Prior Work - Prior Efforts, why they fall short, references to/cogent summaries of literature
    - Summary of contributions - how paper goes beyond prior efforts
    - paper summary for rest of paper
3. The Problem
4. Our new approach
5. Results
6. Discussions + Interpretation of results, thorough
7. Conclusions - summarize results, future work
8. Appendicies  (for proof, e.g.)
9. Bibliography


## Research Ideas
- ideas from papers in recent lit. - good coverage, community will accept, not re-inventing
- harder - find idea great in isolation, then apply, may have a hard time - better to be connected with community

## Prioritizing Time
- Give each day a theme, try to stick to it
- to do list:
    - stack: new items go to top, not bottom. There is permafrost at bottom.
    - stuff that gets pushed down might re-insert backup if actually important
    - to do shrinks at home, grows on campus, Julius prefers to WFH
    - email adds to to do
    - Julius uses emacs to email him the calendar.


## Best Practices
- paper to arkiv, code to github, readme with instructions to replicate results
- webpage with sound examples, paper, code, videos, etc.

## Conference Proceedings
 - Fast, quick dissemination, high acceptance rates
 - HTML page of rweb traffic
 - Journals useful for tenure, but don't usually publish here
 - Link to a video on making posters

## Tips on Writing
 - Read good writing to get in the voice

## How it realy works
 - top positions are based on 'like' factor - rec lettters
 - don't let work distract from likeability, likeability also better for well-being
