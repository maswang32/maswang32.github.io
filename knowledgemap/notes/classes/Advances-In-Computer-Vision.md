## Image Formation
Week 1, Thursday
### Pinhole Cameras
-Why don't you see an image when you hold up a piece of paper?
    - Each point in space reflects in all directions, which get spread out across the paper
    - Conversely, each point on the paper gets light from multiple points in the scene.
- Pinhole camera light in such that each point on the image corresponds to a point from an object
- Get an image on the other side
- Tradeoff between brightness and sharpness
## Derivation
- Establish 3D camera system.
- center = pinhole cetner.
- z = distance from pinhole center
- x and y are up and side
- right handed in real-world space
- f = distance from pinhole to image plance
