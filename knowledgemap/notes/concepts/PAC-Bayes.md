# PAC Bayes

## Countable hypothesis bound.


$$
R(h) \leq \hat{R}(h) + \Delta \sqrt{\frac{\log \frac{1}{P(h)} + \log \frac{1}{\delta}}{2n}}
$$


for a bad prior, the trained model doesn't really fit it, making the bound vacuous.

1. decide priors
2. train a model
3. measure empirical risk
4. calculate P(h), decide gamma, plug in.


Why does pretraining work so well?

fine-tuning


maybe D
