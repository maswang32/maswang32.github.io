# Fourier Dualities

Why is multiplication in time convolution in frequency?

Think of representing your signal as a sum of complex sinusoids at different frequencies.

This is a polynomial!

The coefficients are the frequency domain representation

What happens when you mutiply two polynomials?

You convolve their coefficients.
