# KL-Divergence
Asymmetric
DKL(P||Q) - symbols are drawn from P, but if we encode assuming drawn from Q, 
how many extra bits on expectation are used
Ex~p[log(P(x))-log(Q(x))]
Asymmetric b/c depends on which distribution you're sampling from - two examples
(Should read more)

how much more suprised you'd be seeing P while expecting Q
