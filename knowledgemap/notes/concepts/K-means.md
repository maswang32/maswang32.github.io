 - represent the data by K vectors.
- This can also be viewed as the minimization of a loss function
- can be thought of a reconstruction error.
- in assignment, we minimize the assignments to minimize error (fix c, optimize i)
- in other step, fix indexing of all datapoints, then update its center.
- type of autoencoder.
- latent representation = one hot vector
- works on MNIST - kmeans learns numbers
- can run on 8x8 image patches
