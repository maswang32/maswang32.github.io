# Jensens Inequality

Imagine a bunch of datapoints lying on log(y)

Imagine a point (E[y], E[log[y]])

This is the midpoint of all the datapoints
This will lie under the log(y) curve by concavity:
f((1-a)x + a*y) >= (1-a)f(x) + a*f(y)

The midpoint will lie under the log curve
It is thus lower than

(E[y], log(E[y])) which is on the curve.
