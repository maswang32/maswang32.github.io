# Representation Learning

Abstractions of raw data (compress, conceptualize)

good representations generalize, transfer learning

Want
-retain info about input
-discard info irrelevant to tasks
-compress information


what is the mutual information between input and output?
what info gets lost when we go from x2 to xn?
can we compare two NNs?
