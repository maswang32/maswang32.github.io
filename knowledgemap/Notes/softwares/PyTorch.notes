Datasets:
---need __len__ and __get_item__

Dataloaders
---collate_fn defines how the different data examples should be turned into a batch

Backwards:
---fills "grad" field of every tensor that requires it

Zero_grad
---turns "grad" field of every tensor that requires it to 0

optimizer.step()
---the optimizer has a bunch of parameters stored in it, and it looks at the gradient of all the parameters
and then does a backward step
